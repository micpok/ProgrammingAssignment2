## This file contains the two functions required for Programming Assignment 2
## 1. makeCacheMatrix
## 2. cacheSolve

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of a special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
## cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
